# Project Organization

## Working Example: Replicating Mankiw, Romer and Weil's 1992 QJE

Throughout our tutorial we are going to use a running example to illustrate the concepts we discuss.


## Project Structure I: Separating Inputs and Outputs

Structuring our project and the locations of files is an important concept.

We recommend the following structure for any project:

* Root Folder
* `src` folder for input files
* `out` folder for output files
* a `log` folder to store computer logs

We discuss each of these in turn.

### The Root Folder

TBD

### The `src` folder

TBD

### The `out` folder

TBD

### The `log` folder

## Project Structure II: Separating Logical Chunks of the Project

TBD - disciplined subdirectory structure

## Exploring the Structure of the MRW replication

TBD - openly discuss the structure of our working example

## Project Structure III: Separating Input Parameters from Code

TBD
