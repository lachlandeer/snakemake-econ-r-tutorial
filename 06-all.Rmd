# An `all` Rule

In our analysis pipeline that we have constructed so far,
    we need to make two calls to snakemake to run all of our analysis:

1. `snakemake estimate_models` - to estimate OLS regressions
2. `snakemake make_figs` - to construct the figures

Whilst this is not too time consuming, it would be desirable to only have to run Snakemake once
    and have all our analysis in (1) and (2) be executed.
That is our next goal.

So that we are all starting from the same directory structure, let's clean our output directory,
    removing all estimated models and figures:
```
$ snakemake clean
```
Now if we list the contents of the `out` directory and any potential subdirectories:
```
$ ls -R out/
```
we see that there are no contents remaining:
```
out/:
```
