# Automatic Wildcard Specifications

So far when we have wanted to expand wildcards we have manually specified the values we want them to take.
By doing so, the beginning of our Snakefile looks like this:

```{r, engine = 'bash', eval = FALSE}
MODELS = [
          "solow",
          "aug_solow"
          ]

DATA_SUBSET = [
                "oecd",
                "intermediate",
                "nonoil"
                ]

FIGURES = [
            "aug_conditional_convergence",
            "conditional_convergence",
            "unconditional_convergence"
            ]
```

This is not too problematic when we only have a few values that we want the wildcard to take,
    but manually specifying long lists can get tedious and is prone to error.
Snakemake has a built in function, `glob_wildcard` that will help us to remove the manual listing of values that we have above.
