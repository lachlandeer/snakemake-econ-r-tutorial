Before proceeding to understanding how to use Snakemake and R to construct a reproducible workflow, the next chapter first takes a deeper dive into the a protypical way to set up a research project on our computer. Exercise: Your own project’s steps Think about a project you are working on or have worked on in the past (it may be a Bachelor or Master’s thesis or a recent / active research project). Does your project fit into the 5 steps we described above? If not, what would you modify or add to our 5 steps? (Do you think this would destroy the general principles we will encourage over the next chapters?) A complete replication using the concepts presented in this tutorial is available here↩ "],
